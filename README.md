### Introduction
Data visualization is an essential part of data analysis and communication, as it allows us to understand and interpret data more effectively through visual representations such as charts, graphs, and maps. It can be used by teachers to display student test results, by computer scientists exploring advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) or by executives looking to share information with stakeholders and also plays an important role in big data projects. With the help of Data visualization, business users gain insight into their vast amount of data and get benefits from them to recognize new patterns and errors in the data. Making sense of these patterns help the users to pay attention to the areas that indicate red flags and progress.
